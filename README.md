## What you can do as Developer

As a developer, we tend to bend to the wishes of our customer. In this case, this is actually causing the problem.

It is your job to also inform your client/customer that the decision to support IE 11 is a very short-sighted one.

- You are punishing all other customers. Javascript would need to be compiled to ES5 instead of ES 6 which increases the bundle size in some cases by 30%. So a significant performance decrease for 97% of users;
- Your development time increased by 30%. The time that could be spent on new features/quality improvement;
- Maintenance time increases. As code gets ‘hacked’ for IE. Then the next developer sees that mess and tries to figure out what is going on;
- Overall the Development time is about 10–30% higher for supporting IE 11;
- Have meetings / Information Events with Non-Technical People to talk with them about the IE 11 situation.
